Human Stress Classification Based on HRV Using Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for classifying human stress levels using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features extracted from physiological signals. The project explores and compares different ML models for accurate stress prediction, aiming to contribute to health monitoring and mental well-being solutions.

üìå Project Overview
Stress is a major factor affecting physical and mental health. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a physiological marker that reflects stress-related changes in the autonomic nervous system. This project leverages HRV data and machine learning algorithms to classify human stress levels into various categories (e.g., stressed vs. non-stressed).

üß† Objectives
Extract meaningful HRV features from ECG or PPG data

Train and evaluate different machine learning models

Identify the best-performing model for stress classification

Analyze feature importance and model interpretability

üìÅ Dataset
Source: [e.g., WESAD, Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers, or custom-collected data]

Data Includes:

RR intervals

Time-domain features (e.g., RMSSD, SDNN)

Frequency-domain features (e.g., LF, HF, LF/HF ratio)
